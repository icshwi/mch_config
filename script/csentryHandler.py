"""
Script to handle NAT MCH board in CSEntry

This is a helper script for the MHC config tool (Bash) to handle the access
to the CSEntry API.
The main purpose of this module is to access the CSEntry data base to check if
a given MAC address is already registered or not. If not, the script will
create a new host device and it will associate the MAC address to it.

The script is intended to be called as an standalone module from the main
tool. The script will receive two positional arguments: the serial number of the
MCH and the MAC address.
The returned value will be 0 if either there's an existing MCH with that MAC
address or a new one was created. And a negative value if any error ocurred.
